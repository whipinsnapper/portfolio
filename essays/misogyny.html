            <h3>Part I:</h3>
            <h2>Check Your Privilege</h2>

            <p class="first_p">I used to hate the phrase “check your privilege”. I felt that it attacked me personally and devalued my perspective and my thoughts. I didn’t like being associated with a group of oppressors, or worse identified as one. Hearing that phrase put me on the defensive. In high school, I had so many conversations with female friends where phrases like “I hate men,” “men are the worst,” and “men suck” were dropped constantly, and it made me uncomfortable. On one hand, I wanted to defend myself; I’m not like that, I don’t do that - but on the other hand, I had this desire to empathize, which usually ended up with me responding in agreement: “Yeah, men are the worst, men do suck.” I felt this weird guilt about being a man that I often compare to white guilt, taking responsibility for injustices that I didn’t cause. But this “responsibility” wasn’t active, it was reactive; instead of taking proactive measures to understand and be aware of systemic injustice, I felt the need to apologize for things I didn’t do, and feel bad about myself for being a man. I wanted to comfort myself because of the position I found myself in.</p>
            <p>This is a misunderstanding of what it means to check your privilege. In uncomfortable conversations where you find yourself in the majority group, it is so easy to jump to the defensive. We see these defensive reactions happen all the time when systemic issues are addressed. A few years ago, the #MeToo movement brought the prevalence of sexual harassment and rape to light, with countless women sharing their personal experiences online. The goals of this movement include providing space for victims of sexual violence to not suffer in silence and to see that they’re not alone, as well as raise general awareness that sexual violence is a pervasive element of Hollywood as well as society as a whole. In response, many men reacted with #NotAllMen, a defensive reaction meant to communicate that not all men rape. A similar reaction occurred when Black Lives Matter rose to popularity, and people began saying All Lives Matter.</p>
            <p>What finally made me begin to realize the problem with reacting defensively to conversations around social injustice actually came from a video of Jerry Seinfeld. **give context to video** “I haven’t found [the humor of it]. Nor do I seek it.” That phrase at the end, “nor do I seek it”, was eye opening for me. As somebody who used to say the n-word and defend myself for using it, I began to wonder if my defense really held any weight.</p>
            <p>I came to the conclusion that I simply don’t have the perspective to judge where the n-word should and shouldn’t be used. There is no equivalent word that can be said to me that carries so much weight and potential to hurt, so who am I to say what does and doesn’t offend? I realized that my right to use the n-word and the stigma that surrounds it means nothing when compared to the oppression that black people have faced for countless years, and the injustice they continue to face. My efforts to protect and defend should not go towards something so selfish as my right to say a word without getting backlash; I should put that effort towards real, systemic injustices that affect lives.</p>
