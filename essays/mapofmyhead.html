            <p class="first_p">I look out at the golden, jagged skyline ahead of me. Stony peaks, glistening lakes, and the hazy glow of the sunset meet my eyes as a cool breeze meets my skin. The rock I sit on is flat enough to be comfortable but cold enough to remind me of where I am. It’s day 10, and I’m tired from all the walking—dozens and dozens of miles, day after day.</p>
            <p>Muir Pass. This was the first time I had felt what I would then call the Spirit in what felt like ages. A warm feeling of gratitude and love that almost passes from an emotion to a physical sensation. I wouldn’t learn of my depression until years later. What I thought back then were my own shortcomings—trials and tribulations in my life, sins, temptations, feeling lost and broken—turned out to be side effects of a chemical imbalance in my brain. But in this moment I felt peace. The beauty of the High Sierras brought a light to my life that I hadn’t ever felt before, and a deep, intimate appreciation for Earth’s beauty.</p>
            <p><em>Stinking thinking.</em> Cognitive distortions. If you ask the all-knowing Google what that is, it’ll give you a quote from a website that has a quote from a dictionary that’ll give you a good enough idea of what it is: “a bad way of thinking.” If you actually click the link and read about what it is, you might start to realize why it’s worthwhile to look a little deeper into it. Irrational thoughts. Overgeneralization. Mental filters. The word “should”. I had never heard of the term <em>stinking thinking</em> until a few weeks ago, when my therapist told me about it. I hadn’t considered many things before therapy, and I had no clue how distorted my own perspective was, and how badly the way I thunk stunk.</p>
            <p>Spirituality is an interesting thing, and it’s so personal for everybody. It’s something so intimate and hard to put into words, and no matter how hard I try I feel like words are inadequate. I can paint a little picture, but my hands are shaky and my paint’s cheap. For the majority of my life, I was given a coloring page with lines to stay in. This is the Spirit. This is what invites it. This is what pushes it away. It will tell you this. It won’t tell you that. Not until very, very recently have I considered that maybe those lines can be crossed, or not followed at all. Many people aren’t given that coloring page, and many still are given a completely blank one. But at some point, we will all paint something.</p>
            <p>I wish I could paint. Literally, I mean. Photos can be beautiful, but a painting can capture an element of emotion and personality that you just don’t see in a picture. I have plenty of pictures from Muir Pass, day 10. Hiking the John Muir Trail was one of the most incredible things I’ve ever done in my life, and I’m confident in saying that it’s my favorite place on Earth. I don’t say that lightly. But if I could paint, I’d paint a picture of Muir Pass and how I saw it on day 10. My perspective has changed on so many levels since then. But if I were to go back to that day and sit next to my 17-year-old self, I think I’d feel the exact same way. I’d feel the Spirit. And I’d hug that dirty dude with the stinking thinking and tell him that he’s gonna be okay, and that not too long from then he’d be happier than he ever thought was possible for him. Maybe we’d even compare paintings. His is so similar to mine, but he looks at mine and gets some ideas. I hope he knows I love him.</p>
